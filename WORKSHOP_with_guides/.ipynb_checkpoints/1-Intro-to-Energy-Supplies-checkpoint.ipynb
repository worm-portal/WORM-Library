    "Why is a hot spring interesting? Why do scientists study hot springs as analogs for environments in the past, or on other worlds? Hot springs have many of the features relevant to these environments. In simple terms, hot spring water has relatively reduced stuff dissolved in it from magmatic gases and water-rock reactions deep underground. This reduced stuff comes to the surface and combines with oxidized stuff in the atmosphere. Life can take advantage of this oxidation-reduction differential to obtain energy. It's all connected - some of it is visible, some of it is not. We can use thermodynamic calculations to probe what might be going on."

    "Based on these trends, one possible hypothesis is that the upstream microbes in the Bison Pool outflow channel are consuming sulfide and oxidizing it to sulfate using oxygen. The energy supplied by this reaction is greater than all others (at least among the reactions we have considered).\n",
    "\n",
    "What are some other possibilities that might explain the decrease in sulfide concentration down the Bison Pool outflow channel? Sulfide in its neutral form ($\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$) could offgassing into the atmosphere, or dissolved sulfide could be precipitating into minerals abiotically ([Nordstrom et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2008.11.019); [2005](http://rcn.montana.edu/Publications/Pdf/2005/Nordstrom.pdf)). Whether or not trends in sulfide and sulface can be attributed to biological activity can be tested with field experiments now that we know that energy can be gained from this redox reaction, particularly in the upsteam outflow channel of Bison Pool. By doing a little modeling, we have generated some research questions, a hypothesis, and have even narrowed down a location within an outflow channel to perform an experiment!"
