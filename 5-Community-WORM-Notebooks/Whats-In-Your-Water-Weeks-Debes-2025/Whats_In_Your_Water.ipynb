    "Rock composition plays a significant role in determining the chemical composition of water sources. The common term “rock” is used to describe a solid containing multiple minerals. Minerals are the pure crystalline solid forms of chemical compounds with distinct physical and chemical properties. Minerals can be dissolved by water leading to increased aqueous (dissolved in water) concentrations of the mineral’s component elements (ions). You have probably observed this “water-rock reaction” on a much smaller scale in your kitchen when you make a glass of salt water. Common table salt (NaCl) is a mineral called halite.\n",

    "A higher concentration isn’t always associated with a color change, however. Let’s revisit the table salt example from earlier. Dissolving halite (table salt) into water does not change the color of the solution, but the water will taste saltier as you add more table salt. If you were to add a couple of grains of table salt to a glass of water you probably wouldn’t be able to taste any difference but if you add a tablespoon of salt your glass of water would taste like the ocean! By adding more table salt to the glass of water, you are increasing the concentration of sodium ($Na^{+}$) and chloride ($Cl^{-}$) ions in the solution. Tasting chemical solutions is never a good idea so scientists have invented specialized machines to analyze the chemical concentrations in water!"

However, it is important to note that once minerals are dissolved in water, their dissolved ionic parts can combine and form new compounds that may be different from the starting compounds. For example positive sodium ions, $Na^{+}$, from halite can combine with a negative sulfate ion, $SO_{4}^{2-}$, from anhydrite dissolving to form a new compound, $Na_{2} SO_{4}$.

As of September 2022, the Michigan government announced that it was in its final phase of replacing old lead service lines with modern infrastructure. The city of Flint and the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy reports that 95% of the old infrastructure has been updated. Flint water quality is still being continuously monitored and infrastructure upgrades are in progress."
