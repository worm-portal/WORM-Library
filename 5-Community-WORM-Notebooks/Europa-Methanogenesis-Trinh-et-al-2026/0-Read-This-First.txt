This directory hosts all code used to perform calculations and generate plots in Trinh+ (2026) JGR Planets. We recommend running the notes in the following order:

1. Custom-Database-Kev.ipynb ==> Generates a thermodynamic datafile at the T-P conditions of interest.
2. Run-All-Models.ipynb ==> Perform all speciation and fluid mixing calculations. Save model outputs as Pickle files.
3. Make-Figure-2.ipynb ==> Plot the oxidation state of fluid mixing.
4. Make-Figure-3.ipynb ==> Plot the results of one fluid mixing model.
5. Make-Figure-4.ipynb ==> Plot the parameter senstivity of the hot reservoir in terms of energy supply.
6. Make-Figure-S1.ipynb ==> Plot the equilibrium constant of CO2/HCO3- conversion.
7. Make-Figure-S2.ipynb ==> Plot Figure 4 but for the cold reservoir too.
