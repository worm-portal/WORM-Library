    "\n",
    "The Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equation of state is widely used in aqueous geochemistry to model how the standard state Gibbs free energies of formation of solutes change with temperature and pressure. The equation is used by WORM tools like pyCHNOSZ and AqEquil to calculate reaction properties such as equilibrium constants at elevated temperatures and pressures.\n",

    "Most aqueous chemical species in the [WORM thermodynamic database](https://worm-portal.asu.edu/docs/database/) have values for all seven HKF parameters in addition to standard state properties like Gibbs free energy of formation (G), enthalpy (H), third law entropy (S), volume (V), and heat capacity (Cp).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Non-aqueous molecules do not use HKF parameters. Instead, non-aqueous use a different equation called the Maier-Kelley equation of state. This equation of state has its own parameters ($a, b, c, d, e, f, \\lambda$ (lambda)). The WORM database has entries for crystalline and gaseous chemical species. Their Maier-Kelley coefficients share columns with aqueous HKF coefficients. For example, the HKF omega parameter for an aqueous species shares the same column as the Maier-Kelley lambda parameter, so the column name is \"omega.lambda\".

    "\n",
    "Let's say you're interested in obtaining an equilibrium constant for a reaction at elevated temperatures and pressures using the HKF equation (e.g. while using pyCHNOSZ or AqEquil). However, you realize that one of the molecules in your reaction is not in the thermodynamic database. For example, let's assume that aqueous **hexanoic acid** is missing from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, this would not be a problem. The aqueous organic estimator (AqOrg) tool on WORM was built to estimate properties and HKF parameters of aqueous organic nonelectrolytes (see demos 4-1-1 and 4-1-2 in the WORM Library). Aqueous hexanoic acid is an organic nonelectrolyte, so it seems like a perfect candidate for AqOrg. Unfortunately for us, there are no published methods for estimating the properties of a carboxylic acid functional group compatible with the group additivity scheme used by AqOrg. As a result, AqOrg will throw a big red error message saying that it cannot estimate the properties of hexanoic acid. ðŸ˜”\n",

    "Fortunately, there are published strategies for estimating HKF paramters based on 25 Â°C and 1 bar standard state properties of aqueous molecules. These strategies are outlined in works such as [Shock and Helgeson 1988](https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(88)90181-0) (for ionic species), [Shock and Helgeson 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(90)90429-O) (for organic electrolytes and nonelectrolytes), [Plyasunov and Shock 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0016-7037(01)00678-0) (for nonelectrolytes when starting with hydration properties), and [Sverjensky et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2013.12.019) (for solutes used with the Deep Earth Water, DEW, model).\n",

    "What next? If hexanoic acid was actually absent from the WORM database then we might follow this procedure to get hexanoic acid to show up in our modeling calculations:\n",
    "1. download a copy of the [WORM database CSV file](https://github.com/worm-portal/WORM-db/blob/master/wrm_data.csv)\n",
    "2. add a new line for \"hexanoic-acid\" (be sure to replace spaces with dashes in chemical species names, and don't use a name that is already in the database)\n",
    "3. fill out the columns for \"hexanoic-acid\" while referencing [the WORM database documentation](https://worm-portal.asu.edu/docs/database/)\n",
    "   - the \"omega\" HKF parameter goes in the \"omega.lambda\" column, the \"a1\" parameter goes in the \"a1.a\" column, etc.\n",
    "   - if you only need this database for a pyCHNOSZ calculation, you can ignore all of the columns to the right of \"z.T\".\n",
    "   - if you need this database for a speciation calculation with AqEquil, you need to fill out all of the columns in the CSV. The exception is the \"dissrxn\" column which you can leave blank if you'd prefer the chemical species' dissociation reaction to be generated automatically for you.\n",
    "4. import your CSV into your tool of choice.\n",
    "  \n",
    "For example, importing a custom CSV database into pyCHNOSZ can be done with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from pyCHNOSZ import *\n",
    "_ = thermo(\"WORM\")\n",
    "_ = add_OBIGT(\"my_custom_database.csv\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# ... your calculation goes here, e.g., using subcrt()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing a custom database into AqEquil can be done with:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with thermodynamic databases can be tricky to get right the first time. If you reach a point where you get stuck and need clarification to proceed, feel free to reach out to the WORM administrator Grayson Boyer (email: gmboyer at asu dot edu) and ask to join the WORM Slack community where these kinds of questions get answered."
