    "Marine hydrothermal vents are teeming with thermophilic (heat-loving) chemotrophic (chemical-eating) microbes thriving at the interface between reduced vent fluid and oxidized seawater. This provides a redox gradient perfect for obtaining energy by catalyzing redox reactions.\n",

    "You have been given a CSV file, `S&C10vents_energy.csv`, containing water chemistry data for basal seawater (BSW) and seven vent fluids from around the world. Let's investigate a variety of redox reactions to determine which are energy-yielding in these fluids.\n",

    "    b) Sulfur disproportionating microbes have indeed been detected in marine hydrothermal vent communities. [Alain et al.

How does this value compare to energy estimated from the TAG fluid in this dataset?\n",

    "3) Sulfur exists in many oxidation states in and around seafloor vents, like $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$, $\\text{FeS}_{(cr)}$, $\\text{FeS}_{2(cr)}$, $\\text{S}_{(cr)}^\\circ$, $\\text{SO}_3^{-2}$, $\\text{S}_2\\text{O}_3^{-2}$ , $\\text{SO}_4^{-2}$, etc. ([Alain et al., 2022](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.15975)).\n",

    "    a) Try combining half reactions containing sulfur compounds into full redox reactions and calculating affinity per mole of electrons transferred. Are there any reactions that yield energy in pure vent fluid but not in pure seawater?\n",

    "    b) Add a new half reaction from the list that doesn't contain sulfur or a mineral. Plot affinities and energy supplies. Are there reactions where the affinity is high, but energy supply is low? What about the opposite?\n",
