This may produce the serpentine mineral [chrysotile](https://www.mindat.org/min-975.html) as well as [talc](https://www.mindat.org/min-3875.html) and [tremolite](https://www.mindat.org/min-4011.html), cause the pH of the fluid to dramatically increase until it becomes hyperalkaline (pH >10 at low temperature), and may ultimately reach equilibrium with diopside.\n",

If not, the calculation ends when the reactant mineral is exhausted and has been completely altered into new minerals and a changed fluid composition."
