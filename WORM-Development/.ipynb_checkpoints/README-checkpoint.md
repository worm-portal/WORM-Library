## About

The WORM (Water Organic Rock Microbe) Library is a growing collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks covering a variety of geochemical modeling and thermodynamic property estimation topics. Some notebooks serve as introductory material for users seeking to learn more about modeling concepts and how to use the tools on WORM to answer their science questions. These notebooks are written in a conversational style with embedded pictures and figures. Other notebooks are aimed at more experienced users who want stripped-down examples of code functionality.

### Usage

All notebooks are available and fully interactive on the [WORM Portal](worm-portal.asu.edu). To access them, log in with your GitLab credentials (or create a new account) and navigate to the WORM-Library folder. In the 1-Introduction folder, double-click on 1-Introduction.ipynb to open the introductory notebook to learn more about getting started with the other demos.
