    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how to set up a geochemical speciation calculation with a variety of water chemistry datasets from around the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each speciation calculation should produce a CSV report with results. Results can also be visualized in this notebook in a variety of ways. Check out the other aqueous speciation demo notebooks available through the WORM Library to learn how to plot mass contributions of elements, mineral saturation indices, solid solutions, water-rock reaction paths, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a good idea for a dataset, please email me at gmboyer@asu.edu with a link! That way, this list can grow and grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is meant to get you started with speciation calculations. You can speciate all of the water chemistry datasets just by selecting the *Kernel* tab, then *Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of each speciation calculation are saved as a CSV, and are also stored in the variable at the beginning of each cell. For example, the Salt and Verde River speciation results are stored in a variable called `sp_salt_river`. This allows you to plot results from the speciation using built-in functions. For example, once the speciation is complete, you can try\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sp_salt_river.plot_mass_contribution(\"Ca+2\") \n",
    "```\n",
    "to see how calcium is speciated in the Salt and Verde River samples with an interactive plot. There are many other built-in diagram types available that you can learn about in other Geochemical Speciation notebooks in the WORM-Library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speciation results can also be fed into a mass transfer calculation, where the speciated fluids are reacted with rock. Take a look at the Mass Transfer demo notebooks available through the WORM-Library to learn how to do this.\n",
    "\n",
