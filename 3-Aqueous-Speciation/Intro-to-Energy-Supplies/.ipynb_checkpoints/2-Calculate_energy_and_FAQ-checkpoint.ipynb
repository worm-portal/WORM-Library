Even if a microbe prefers one form of sulfide, it follows that the aqueous system will instantaneously re-equilibrate all sulfide species as the preferred sulfide substrate is consumed.

    "## Frequently asked questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Are microbes present in my system really gaining the energy I calculate from affinity or energy supply?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Not necessarily. A positive affinity or energy supply should be considered an estimate of the maximum amount of energy available from catalyzing a redox reaction. Microbes present in the system *might* be harvesting *some* (or none) of that energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are countless redox reactions that permit estimation of energy yield but microbes have not evolved to catalyze. On the other hand, there might exist microbes that are able to catalyze sulfide oxidation into elemental sulfur, but you might not find them in a system where energy is available from this reaction. Why? They might be outcompeted by other organisms that use sulfide for their own metabolisms. There might be toxic levels of heavy metals or some other solute that is poisonous to sulfide oxidizers in the system. There might be kinetic barriers inhibiting catalysis. There might be some other reason you have not considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The best way to really understand what microbes are actually doing is to combine multiple lines of evidence; Can I detect consumption of reactants? Are products being formed? Can I rule out possible abiotic factors that might cause changes in reactant and product concentrations? Can I detect genetic signals from microoganisms known to catalyze this reaction?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Well then, if I can't use affinities and energy supplies to predict what microbes are actually doing in my system, then what's the point?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Quantifying affinities and energy supplies can help you formulate testable hypotheses about what microbes might be doing in your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For instance, if there is very little energy for hydrogen oxidation, and LOTS of energy for nitrate reduction, then you could hypothesize that more nitrate reducers are present in your system than hydrogen oxidizers. This can guide your approach to understanding of what is likely/unlikely in your system or help you pick out which systems you'd like to study further based on previous geochemical measurements (e.g. selecting a hot spring to visit based on USGS data in order to study sulfide oxidizing bacteria). You can even use energy supply calculations to design growth media with differing energy regimes!\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, if it is absolute certainty you are craving, then you can still benefit from doing affinity calculations. If you calculate a negative affinity for a particular redox reaction in your system, this is a guarantee that there is no energy available from catalyzing that reaction in the forward direction as written. This is strong evidence that microbes reliant on reactions that result in negative affinities will not be present.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Why is affinity per mole of reaction used to calculate energy supply? Why not use affinity per mole of electrons transferred?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Recall the affinity per mole of electrons transferred, $\\text{A}_e$, can be calculated from affinity per mole of reaction, $\\text{A}_r$, by dividing the latter by moles of electrons transferred per mole of reaction as written, $\\text{e}^-_r$\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\text{A}_e = \\frac{A_r}{e^-_r}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Energy supply can be calculated by multiplying $\\text{A}_e$ by $e^-_{trans}$, the maximum moles of electrons that can possibly be transferred in a reaction per kilogram of fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$E = A_e\\cdot e^-_{trans}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    It follows that $e^-_{trans}$ can be calculated from\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$e^-_{trans} = [lim]e^-_{lim}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $[lim]$ is the concentration of the reactant that limits the donation or acceptance of electrons, and $e^-_{lim}$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$e^-_{lim} = \\frac{e^-_r}{S_{lim}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $S_{lim}$ is the stoichiometric reaction coefficient of the limiting reactant. The previous four equations combine into\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$E = \\frac{A_r}{e^-_r}[lim]\\frac{e^-_r}{S_{lim}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    which simplifies into our original equation for energy supply:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ \\text{E = A}_r \\frac{[lim]}{S_{lim}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is a long-winded way of showing that energy supply calculations already account for quantities of electrons transferred. No further normalization is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Should I normalize energy supplies by the number of electrons transferred?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    No. Refer to the response to the previous question. Quantities of electrons are already accounted for in the energy supply calculation. Normalization per mole of electrons transferred is only appropriate for affinities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How do I calculate Gibbs free energy instead of affinity?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can calculate the Gibbs free energy of a reaction with the `calculate_energy` function just as you would for affinity; just set the parameter `y_type=\"G\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why use affinity instead of Gibbs free energy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can use either. Chemical affinity is equal to negative Gibbs free energy change for a reaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\text{A}_r = -\\Delta_r \\text{G}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Same goes for affinities and Gibbs free energies normalized to electrons transferred:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\text{A}_e = -\\Delta_e \\text{G}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Positive affinities are associated with reactions that occur spontaneously in the forward direction. If you find it helpful to mentally associate positive values with reactions that yield energy, consider adopting affinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why doesn't `calculate_affinity()` automatically calculate number of electrons transferred in a redox reaction when other WORM functions like `make_redox_reactions()` can already do this?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The `calculate_energy` function is designed to be a lot more flexible with the reactions that can be modeled. It is possible to calculate affinities and energy supplies for very complicated reactions that include many different oxidants, reductants, and other chemical species that do not participate in redox. It may be possible to programatically determine which elements are being oxidized and reduced and derive electrons transferred in very complicated reactions possible with `calculate_energy`, but this has not yet been implemented into WORM.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is the minimum energy requirement for a living cell?** This question is still being investigated! Based on field and culture studies, a minimum Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta\\text{G}_{min}$) somewhere between -9 to -15 kJ/mol has been proposed for static and starving microbes ([Hoeler, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4677.2004.00033.x); [Schink & Stams, 2002](https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/server/api/core/bitstreams/c9eef979-83e3-467e-b351-23a11796eb28/content)), or ~ -20 kJ/mol for growing microbes. [LaRowe and Amend (2015)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00718) and [Bradley (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba0697) investigate energy minimums in terms of power (energy over time) to understand how microbes are supported in low energy flux systems like seafloor sediments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aren't solutes in equilibrium with each other after a geochemical speciation calculation? How can there be any energy available in a system at equilibrium?** The speciation code used by AqEquil is called EQ3/6. It has the ability to calculate \"partial equilibrium\" if concentrations of chemical species containing more than one oxidation state are provided in the water chemistry input file. For example, if you define concentrations of sulfide and sulfate that are out of equilibrium in the input file, the speciation calculation will calculate partial equilibrium for the system that takes this into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Speciation calculations notoriously permit elements of one oxidation state to speciate into others at low temperatures where redox equilibration is kinetically inhibited. How can I prevent this from happening in my calculation?** In systems that are below about 300 °C, redox reactions tend to be kinetically inhibited and slow compared to near-instantaneous reactions like complexation and protonation/deprotonation. For example, you shouldn't expect acetic acid sitting on a countertop to abiotically react with atmospheric oxygen to instantaneously form CO2. We should be thankful for this, too, because our human metabolisms depend on catalyzing the oxidation of organic molecules that are kinetically \"trapped\" in disequilibrium with carbon in the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "    But if we do a speciation calculation for a system at low temperature, we might get unwanted behavior. For example, bicarbonate in our input file might speciate into carbon compounds with other oxidation states like CO, CH4, and organic molecules, especially in a reduced system. Further, if we measured Fe+2 ions in our water sample, a speciation calculation might turn it all into Fe+3 in an oxidized system. This would be accurate according to thermodynamics, but it does not take the slow kinetics of redox reactions into account. We do not actually expect rapid redox equilibration to be happening at low temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "    So how can we prevent this? How can we do a speciation calculation while preserving the oxidation states of elements in compounds specified in an input file? One trick is to treat each oxidation state as its own element. For example, treat C+4 in CO2 as one element, and C-4 in CH4 as another element. This prevents CO2 and CH4 from equilibrating with each other in a speciation calculation, because one element is not allowed to transform into another. The AqEquil code has a built-in way to do this using the parameter `suppress_redox` when loading thermodynamic data. For example, isolating carbon oxidation states:\n",
    "\n",

It contains some dissolved methane, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), acetic acid, and little else. If we want to calculate energy supply for methane and DIC reacting to form acetic acid, there are many ways to write the reaction. Here are a couple of ways:\n",

    "\n",
    "    Technically true! But think about what happens if we let the second reaction proceed in our system, assuming the concentration of $HCO_3^-$ is small in our pH 2 system. As $HCO_3^-$ is consumed and converted into acetic acid, dissolved $CO_2$ will near-instantaneously react with water to replenish the ratio of $HCO_3^-$ to $CO_2$. Thus, there is *always* some $HCO_3^-$ present in the system unless all DIC is consumed in the reaction.\n",

    "- **Does energy supply take into account the fact that consuming reactants and forming products causes affinity and limiting reactant concentrations to shift as the redox reaction proceeds toward equilibrium?** In an energy supply calculation, we are assuming that there is no reaction progress. We snap our fingers and all reactants instantaneously react to form products until the limiting reactant runs out. This snapshot mentality lets us compare energy supplies calculated for \"open systems\" (e.g., a stream) to those of \"closed systems\" (e.g., a stagnant pond). In an open system, one can argue that microbes do not \"feel\" reaction progress because nutrients are constantly replenished and waste is swept away. In a closed system, it is possible that by the time you walk up to take a water sample, the microbial communities have already established a nutrient cycling steady state that also does not \"feel\" reaction progress. Of course, this is all theory and deserves to be investigated further! Maybe there is a better way to quantify energy supplies and you will be the one to publish it!"
